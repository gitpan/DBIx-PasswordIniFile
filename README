DBIx::PasswordIniFile
=====================

WHAT IS THIS ?
--------------

DBIx::PasswordIniFile allows you to configure database connections (via DBI)
based on property / value pairs stored in Windows .ini style files.

I've written this module as part of a Perl application where properties of 
only one database connection (username, password, server, port, ...) has to
be maintained, and I don't like the solution provided by DBIx::Password
where properties of connections are part of the Perl code itself.

Note that this module is not a replacement of DBIx::Password. The main
difference between both modules is that DBIx::Password is oriented to store
a lot of virtual users inside the module source code itself. On the opposite,
DBIx::PasswordIniFile is oriented to store one virtual user, although you
may to store one per section in a .ini file.

If you have a lot of virtual users, I recommend you to use DBIx::Password,
because probably it will be much fast than this module.

This module uses one or two sections of a .ini file and ignores the rest 
of its content.
This .ini file may be a configuration file that you already use with other
purposes, or a new .ini file dedicated to store database conection
properties.
Below is a sample one:

  # Sample fragment of a .ini file needed by this module.
  [connection]
  host=www.freesql.org
  database=database_name
  driver=mysql
  username=your_username
  password=52616e646f6d4956e162a17a197ce0a09fa35ff471cf9f7a2ccddaca1c857bdd
  
The password is stored encrypted (so the list of alphanumeric digits).
Accompaning the module there is an utility called encryptpassw.pl, that lets
you write your password in clear form and rewrites it encrypted. This utility
ignore all the file contents except password property / value. See its
POD documentation.


HOW TO INSTALL
-------------

Installation is as any ordinary module, except for tests be correctly executed,
you have to have at hand one database connection, and supply its properties as
answers to questions during install process.

make Makefile.PL (answer some questions)
make
make tests
make install

Windows users have to use nmake instead of make.


REQUISITES
----------

Perl v5.8.6 or above has to be installed. If not, an error

   Free to wrong pool XXX not YYY during global destruction

is displayed, and Perl crashes.

An encription module has to be installed. Default is to use
C<Crypt::Blowfish_PP> for encription and decryption. If not installed, 
specify your preferred (without C<Crypt::> prefix).
