DBIx::PasswordIniFile
=====================

WHAT IS THIS ?
--------------

DBIx::PasswordIniFile allows you to configure DBI database connections,
storing them in .ini configuration files, with password encription.

I've written this module as part of a Perl application where properties of 
only one database connection (DBI dsn, user and password) has to
be maintained, and I don't like the solution provided by DBIx::Password
where properties of connections are part of the Perl code itself.

Note that this module is not a replacement of DBIx::Password. The main
difference between both modules is that DBIx::Password is oriented to store
a lot of virtual users inside the module source code itself. On the opposite,
DBIx::PasswordIniFile is oriented to store one virtual user per section in a 
.ini configuration file.

If you have a lot of virtual users, I recommend you to use DBIx::Password,
because probably it will be much fast than this module.

This module uses one section of a .ini file and ignores the rest of its content.
This .ini file may be a configuration file that you already use with other
purposes, or a new .ini file dedicated to store database conection
properties.
Below is a sample:

  # Sample fragment of a .ini file used by this module.
  [connection]
  dsn=dbi:mysql:database=databasename;host=www.freesql.org
  user=your_username
  pass=52616e646f6d4956e162a17a197ce0a09fa35ff471cf9f7a2ccddaca1c857bdd
  
The password is stored encrypted (note the list of alphanumeric digits).
Accompaning the module there is an utility called encryptpassw.pl, that lets
you write your password in clear form and rewrites it encrypted. This utility
ignore all the file contents except password property / value. See its
POD documentation.


HOW TO INSTALL
-------------

Installation is as any ordinary module:

make Makefile.PL (answer some questions)
make
make test
make install

Windows users may use nmake or gmake instead of make.

PREREQUISITES
----------

Perl v5.8.6 or above has to be installed. If not, an error

   Free to wrong pool XXX not YYY during global destruction

is displayed, and Perl crashes.

This module depend on these:

  Config::IniFiles
  Crypt::CBC
  Crypt::Blowfish
  DBI
  File::HomeDir
  
An encription module has to be installed. Default is to use Crypt::Blowfish for 
encription and decryption. Or you may specify your preferred without Crypt:: 
prefix.
